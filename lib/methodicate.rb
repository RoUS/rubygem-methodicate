  #
  class Object
    #
    # Since the Methodicate class conceals its involvement in object
    # access, this method provides an authoritative way to find out if
    # a particular object is wrapped or not.
    #
    # @return [Boolean]
    #  By default, {#methodicated?} will return <tt>false</tt> for all
    #  objects.

#
# The <tt>Methodicate</tt> class provides a wrapper mechanism so that
# nested objects (particularly
# {http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html Enumerable} ones)
# can be accessed using a method-chain syntax regardless of the actual
# object type.  For example:
#
# @example Illustrative mixed structure to be methodicated:
#  hsh = {
#    'A'     => 'a string',
#    'B'     => :a_symbol,
#    'a'     => [ 'an', 'array' ],
#    :a      => {
#      'h1'  => 'hv1',
#      :h2   => [ 'h', 'v', '2' ],
#      'H3'  => [
#                 [ 'deep', 'array'],
#                 { :deeper => :hash },
#               ],
#    },
#  }
#  data = Methodicate.new(hsh)
#
# @example Accessing attributes/elements <i>via</i> method-like syntax:
#  data.A
#  => "a string"
#  data.B
#  => :a_symbol
#
# @example <tt>Symbol</tt> keys dominate <tt>String</tt> keys:
#  data.a
#  => { "h1" => "hv1", :h2 => [ "h", "v", "2" ], "H3" => [[ "deep", "array" ], { :deeper => :hash }] }
#
# @example Indexed access is still available (and sometimes required):
#  data['A']
#  => "a string"
#  data[:a]
#  => { "h1" => "hv1", :h2 => [ "h", "v", "2" ], "H3" => [[ "deep", "array" ], { :deeper => :hash }] }
#  data['a']
#  => [ 'an', 'array' ]
#
# @example Going deeper:
#  data.a.H3.deeper
#  => :hash
#  data.a.h2[1]
#  => "v"
#
class Methodicate

  #
  # Instance methods to supersede in order to make ours a transparent
  # wrapping as much as possible.
  #
  # @note
  #  As part of the transparency imperative, the {Methodicate} object
  #  wrapper will 'fake' the response to the canonical <tt>#class</tt> and
  #  comparison methods (<tt>#\<</tt>, <tt>#==</tt>, <i>etc</i>.), and
  #  pass them through to the wrapped object rather than using the
  #  version inherited by the wrapper itself.  To determine if an
  #  object is wrapped or not, use the {#methodicated?} method.
  #
  # @note
  #  To ensure that comparisons are made against the wrapped object
  #  and not the wrapper, a {Methodicate} object <b>must</b> be on the
  #  <abbr title="left-hand side">LHS</abbr> of the comparison
  #  operator.

  #    and the string is interpretable as an integer, we try that.
